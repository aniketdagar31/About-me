# About-me

My name is Aniket and I'm currently working as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services on Oracle Fusion Cloud HCM, where I configure changes, provide technical support, and implement new features on the Benefits, Core HR and Security modules of the application. 

As a techno-functional consultant, I am responsible for both technical and functional changes. This includes working with fast formulas, updating the application according to client requirements, creating HDL and HSDL templates for loading data, configuring application pages, implementing quarterly feature updates, and preparing progress reports on ongoing changes and incidents to communicate with the client. 

I collaborate closely with team members to address complex problems and analyze various solutions. Additionally, I regularly engage with clients to ensure clear communication regarding requirements and ongoing issues.

Beyond my current role, I am an aspiring data analyst, eager to leverage my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills to derive valuable insights. Being a certified data analyst, I have proficiency in data analysis tools and skills like Excel (functions, power pivots, data visualisation, data auditing, macros, pivot tables), advanced SQL (aggregation functions, joins, window functions, creating database, conditional functions) , data visualization using Power BI/Tableau, understanding of statistical methods and techniques, complex problem solving, and Python. 

I am enthusiastic about taking on new challenges, learning new skills, embracing emerging technologies, and contributing to the success of organizations through innovative solutions.
